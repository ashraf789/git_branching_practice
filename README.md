Git branch practice

1. create branch : git checkout <branchName>
if branch <branchName> is already not present on the system then it will create new branch 

2. pull update from another branch 
git pull <anotherBranch>

3. merge a branch 
git merge <branchName>

4. delete a branch 
git branch -d <branchName>

5. delete branch from host 
git push branch :<branchName>


Note: (git push origin master) to push any update to host
